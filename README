This was compiled using go 1.15.2 linux/amd64 and kataras iris v12. 

To compile and run (with default inputs given in the pdf),
        1. chmod u+x startup.sh 
        2. ./startup.sh 
Make sure all files are within the same directory

Assignment was not fully completed; I had some issues with making 
sure elections were working, then with making sure logs were being 
sent and taking effect across all backends, then with ironing out 
bugs. Everything should work after all backends begin; taking 
backends down can ultimately cause issues though it shouldn't. 
I just ended up experiencing the worst burnout during the last 
days of this project and ultimately couldn't bring myself to 
iron everything out.
